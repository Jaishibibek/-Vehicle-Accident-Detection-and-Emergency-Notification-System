# -Vehicle-Accident-Detection-and-Emergency-Notification-System
The Vehicle Accident Detection and Emergency Notification System is a real-time IoT solution designed to detect car accidents and immediately alert emergency contacts with precise GPS location data. Leveraging an ICM20948 accelerometer and gyroscope, this system can sense sudden impacts or changes in orientation that signify an accident.
Upon detecting an impact, it uses a GSM module to initiate emergency calls and send SMS notifications with a Google Maps link to the accident location.
